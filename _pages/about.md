I’m an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Manitoba.

I earned my Ph.D. at the University of Alberta (Canada), co-advised by Prof. [Linglong Kong](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~lkong/) and Prof. [Bei Jiang](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bei1/). I received my M.S. from the University of Minnesota (USA), advised by Prof. [Yang Li](https://yangli-stat.github.io/) and Prof. [Haiyang Wang](https://www.d.umn.edu/~haiyang/), and my B.S. from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (China).

## Research

My research sits at the intersection of modern machine learning， natural language processing, and statistics, with an emphasis on **trustworthy, practical, and deployable AI**.

**Current themes**
1. **LLMs & NLP**: post-training ([NeurIPS 2025 Workshop](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00977)), agentic systems ([AAMAS 2026 Oral](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17086)), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG; [AAAI 2026 Workshop](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10828), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.19987)), reasoning, evaluation (e.g., LLM-as-judge), and domain applications ([NeurIPS 2024](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/fce2d8a485746f76aac7b5650db2679d-Paper-Conference.pdf)).
2. **Algorithmic fairness & computational social science**: measuring and mitigating social bias in language and AI systems ([PNAS Nexus](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/12/pgae526/7905141?login=false), [NAACL 2024](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-long.332.pdf), [NeurIPS 2022](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/4b52b3c50110fc10f6a1a86055682ea2-Paper-Conference.pdf), [AAAI 2022](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/21443), [Frontiers in Big Data](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/big-data/articles/10.3389/fdata.2022.805713/full), [Cities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264275124003639)).
3. **Statistics + AI for interdisciplinary problems**: privacy ([ICML 2023](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23q.html), [NeurIPS 2023](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/2f27964513a28d034530bfdd117ea31d-Abstract-Conference.html)), health ([BMC Medical Research Methodology](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12874-023-01869-w), [Substance Use & Misuse](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10826084.2024.2383585)), medicine ([Leukemia Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0145212623006197)), anthropology ([Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12520-024-02064-8)), environmental science ([Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651323001070)), and related applied domains.

I’m always open to collaborations with curious and motivated students and researchers. If you’d like to work together, please reach out by email.
