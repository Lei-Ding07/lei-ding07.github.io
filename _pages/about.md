I am a Ph.D. student in Prof. [Linglong Kong](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~lkong/) and Prof. [Jiang Bei](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bei1/) at University of Alberta (UOfA). I obtained my M.S. degree at University of Minnesota with Prof. [Yang Li](https://yangli-stat.github.io/) and Prof. Haiyang Wang(https://www.d.umn.edu/~haiyang/) and B.S. degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT).

I am especially passionate about research in Statitics, Machine learning, Deep learning, Natural langauge processing and their application and impact on the society. As such, I work at the intersection of applying statistical machine learning methods and natural language processing algorithms to investigate the social impact.
