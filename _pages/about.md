I am a Ph.D. student advised by Prof. [Linglong Kong](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~lkong/) and Prof. [Bei Jiang](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bei1/) at University of Alberta (UOfA). I obtained my M.S. degree at University of Minnesota with Prof. [Yang Li](https://yangli-stat.github.io/) and Prof. [Haiyang Wang](https://www.d.umn.edu/~haiyang/) and B.S. degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT).

I am especially passionate about research in Statistics, Machine learning, Deep learning, Natural langauge processing and their application and impact on the society. As such, I work at the intersection of applying statistical machine learning methods and natural language processing algorithms to investigate the social impact.

[University of Alberta Folio](https://www.ualberta.ca/folio/2022/09/ai-researchers-improve-method-for-removing-gender-bias-in-natural-language-processing.html)


## Projects:
1. Research on reducing gender bias using casual inference framework in GloVe word embedding with semantics information retained. 
I'm the leader of the project, work with other team members with the methodology and coding for all the related experiments. Organize regular meetings with team members to manage the whole process of the project. Our paper are accpeted by AAAI 2022 conference. 

2. Research on Using AI to combat gender and ethnic bias in the job market.
I'm heavily involved in an international project that aims to identify and reduce bias in job recruitment and human resource management using responsible artificial intelligence. The project is one of the Canada-UK Artificial Intelligence Initiative. As the leader of the computational team which involves four postdocs and three Ph.D. students from both Canada and the UK, I organized all the important meetings and discussions with my team members and manage the whole process of the project. I am also responsible for communication and management to work interdisciplinary with sociology teams. In particular, I worked on all the coding parts of the projects, from gathering the job market data, preprocessing the data, and training models to generate the word embeddings for our specific job data.

3. Intern for developing machine learning models for the synthesis of structured health data
I worked as an intern on synthesizing structured health data. My responsibility involves building complex state-of-the-art deep learning models for generating longitudinal synthetic data from scratch, implementing various utility evalution methods, discussing with team members for solving critical modeling issues. Our paper is submitted to Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association 2021.

4. Project on prediction of carbon percentage in Alberta soil.
I'm heavily involved in an interdisciplinary project that cooperate with Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute and College of Natural and Applied Sciences. I'm responsible from data prespocessing to performing sophisticated statistical analysis for prediction of carbon soil percentage in Alberta.  I also come up with a novel screening variable method with bootstraps group lasso for statistically evaluating the factors that effect the carbon percentage. A research paper is written and submitted to Science of the Total Environmen 2021.

5. Project on augmented decision making capabilities for innovation management and continuous improvement by organizations.
I'm the leader of the project for helping the human resources company to clustering ideas & comments via different language modelling methods. I implemented various natural language processing models including TF-IDF, averaging word-vectors, doc2vec and RNN with BERT embeddings. The project successfully help the company for saving a lot of cost and human resources for various tasks.

6. Research on Reducing Selection Bias in Counterfactual Reasoning for Individual Treatment Effects Estimation.
I involved in the research project that proposed a novel framework for addressing the issue of selection bias. I was mainly focus on discussing the main methology and proposing a novel synthetic data generating mechanism. Our paper is accepted by NeurIPS 2019 Workshop on "Do the right thing".


2. Intern in Guangzhou Huazi Software Technology Co  2018 \
Built a Recurrent neural network for predicting medical insurance cost for Foshan and Zhanjiang Government; Worked on NLP word correction for OCR with Kneser-Ney smoothing and noisy channel model.

3. Named Entity Recognition model using RNN with Tensorflow 2018\
BImplements bi-directional LSTM for character embeddings. Utilized both Glove word embeddings and character embeddings for prediction. Applied conditional random field on output layer to avoid local labeling bias.

4. Research on Cloud User Interest in P2P Systems 2016
Performed measurements and analysis of cloud peers interest on P2P systems. Built web scraper with Python and modified Ctorrent source code with C++. Performed data analysis and visualization using Jupyter notebook with pandas, numpy and matplotlib. Performed machine learning: clustering algorithm with scikit-learn.

5. Implement a neural based Dependency Parser 2017
Applied fully-connected dense layer as oracle for transitional-based dependency parser. Use embed- ding for POS tag features and word2vec for word embedding.

6. Research on Cooperation of Clustering and Differential Evolution Algorithm 2015
Combining different clustering algorithms: K-means, K-modes, Hierarchical clustering with Differen- tial Evolution algorithm on different functions to improve the searching ability and convergence speed on some difficult optimization problems.

7. Intern in SAMSUNG Advanced Institute of Technology 2015
Intern for 3D Human Face Modeling. Involved in writing Matlab program for registering the face point cloud data to the standard models. Involved in writing C++ code for ECG signals processing.
