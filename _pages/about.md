I am a Ph.D. student advised by Prof. [Linglong Kong](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~lkong/) and Prof. [Bei Jiang](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bei1/) at the University of Alberta (UofA). I obtained my M.S. degree at the University of Minnesota with Prof. [Yang Li](https://yangli-stat.github.io/) and Prof. [Haiyang Wang](https://www.d.umn.edu/~haiyang/) and B.S. degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT).

I am especially passionate about research in Statistics, Machine learning, Deep learning, and Natural language processing and their application and impact on society. As such, I work at the intersection of applying statistical machine learning methods and natural language processing algorithms to investigate social impact.

## Projects:
1. Our work on quantile fairness regression is accepted by Neurips in 2022. We propose that other than focusing on mean prediction, quantile fairness is also an essential concern for the whole of society. We further provide a confromalized prediction interval that is available for quantifying the uncertainty of the fairness algorithm as well as providing a 'fair' prediction interval. 

1. Research on reducing gender bias using casual inference framework in GloVe word embedding with semantics information retained. 
I'm the leader of the project, working with other team members on the methodology and coding for all the related experiments. Organize regular meetings with team members to manage the whole process of the project. Our paper are accepted by AAAI 2022 conference. 

2. Research on Using AI to combat gender and ethnic bias in the job market.
I'm heavily involved in an international project that aims to identify and reduce bias in job recruitment and human resource management using responsible artificial intelligence. The project is one of the Canada-UK Artificial Intelligence Initiative. As the leader of the computational team which involves four postdocs and three Ph.D. students from both Canada and the UK, I organized all the important meetings and discussions with my team members and manage the whole process of the project. I am also responsible for communication and management to work interdisciplinary with sociology teams. In particular, I worked on all the coding parts of the projects, from gathering the job market data, preprocessing the data, and training models to generate the word embeddings for our specific job data.

3. Intern for developing machine learning models for the synthesis of structured health data
I worked as an intern on synthesizing structured health data. My responsibility involves building complex state-of-the-art deep learning models for generating longitudinal synthetic data from scratch, implementing various utility evaluation methods, and discussing with team members for solving critical modeling issues. Our paper is submitted to the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association 2021.

4. Project on prediction of carbon percentage in Alberta soil.
I'm heavily involved in an interdisciplinary project that cooperates with the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute and the College of Natural and Applied Sciences. I'm responsible for data preprocessing to perform sophisticated statistical analysis for the prediction of carbon soil percentage in Alberta.  I also come up with a novel screening variable method with bootstraps group lasso for statistically evaluating the factors that affect the carbon percentage. A research paper is written and submitted to Science of the Total Environment 2021.

5. Project on augmented decision-making capabilities for innovation management and continuous improvement by organizations.
I'm the leader of the project for helping the human resources company cluster ideas & comments via different language modeling methods. I implemented various natural language processing models including TF-IDF, averaging word vectors, doc2vec, and RNN with BERT embeddings. The project successfully helps the company for saving a lot of costs and human resources for various tasks.

6. Research on Reducing Selection Bias in Counterfactual Reasoning for Individual Treatment Effects Estimation.
I was involved in a research project that proposed a novel framework for addressing the issue of selection bias. I was mainly focused on discussing the main methodology and proposing a novel synthetic data-generating mechanism. Our paper is accepted by NeurIPS 2019 Workshop on "Do the right thing".


2. Intern in Guangzhou Huazi Software Technology Co  2018 \
Built a Recurrent neural network for predicting medical insurance costs for Foshan and Zhanjiang Governments; Worked on NLP word correction for OCR with Kneser-Ney smoothing and noisy channel model.

3. Named Entity Recognition model using RNN with Tensorflow 2018\
BImplements bi-directional LSTM for character embeddings. Utilized both Glove word embeddings and character embeddings for prediction. Applied conditional random field on the output layer to avoid local labeling bias.

4. Research on Cloud User Interest in P2P Systems 2016
Performed measurements and analysis of cloud peers' interest in P2P systems. Built web scraper with Python and modified Ctorrent source code with C++. Performed data analysis and visualization using Jupyter notebook with pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib. Performed machine learning: clustering algorithm with scikit-learn.

5. Implement a neural-based Dependency Parser 2017
Applied fully-connected dense layer as an oracle for transitional-based dependency parser. Use embed- ding for POS tag features and word2vec for word embedding.

6. Research on Cooperation of Clustering and Differential Evolution Algorithm 2015
Combining different clustering algorithms: K-means, K-modes, and Hierarchical clustering with Differential Evolution algorithms on different functions to improve the searching ability and convergence speed on some difficult optimization problems.

7. Intern at SAMSUNG Advanced Institute of Technology 2015
Intern for 3D Human Faces Modeling. Involved in writing Matlab program for registering the face point cloud data to the standard models. Involved in writing C++ code for ECG signals processing.
